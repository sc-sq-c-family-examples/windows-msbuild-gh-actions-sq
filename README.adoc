= C++ example project scanned on SonarCloud using GitHub Actions

It is very easy to analyze a C/C++/Objective-C project with SonarQube:

. Create a `sonar-project.properties` file to store your configuration
. In your `.github/workflows/build.yml` file:
.. Download the https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/scan/sonarscanner/[Sonar Scanner]
.. Download the https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/languages/cfamily/#header-4[Build Wrapper]
.. Wrap your compilation with the Build Wrapper
.. Run `sonar-scanner` as the final step
. Make sure that you have your token stored as a secret in your repository (`SONAR_TOKEN`). If you don't have a token yet, you can generate a new one in SonarQube (see https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/user-guide/user-token/[Generating and Using Tokens]).

You can take a look at the link:sonar-project.properties[sonar-project.properties] and link:.github/workflows/build.yml[build.yml] to see it in practice.

= Code Description

An example of a flawed C++ code. The https://github.com/sc-sq-c-family-examples/code[code repository] is meant to be compiled with different build systems using different CI pipelines on Linux, MacOS, and Windows.

The https://github.com/sc-sq-c-family-examples/code[code repository] is forked into other repositories in https://github.com/sc-sq-c-family-examples[this collection] to add a specific build system, platform, and CI.
The downstream repositories are analyzed either with https://www.sonarqube.org/[SonarQube] or https://sonarcloud.io/[SonarCloud].
